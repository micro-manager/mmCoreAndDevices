/**
* The purpose of the NotificationThread is to reduce the risk of lost frames
* due to temporary high CPU loads or delays in MMCore that blocks the PVCAM
* callback thread for excessive amount of time - this in turn leads to lost
* frames because the callback for the frame cannot be called.
*
* The NotificationThread cannot cure slow CPU, slow MMCore or super fast
* cameras used with generally slow application. In such cases a dropped frames
* are inevitable.
*
* Operation
*
* When PVCAM finishes reading out a new frame and sends a callback to the
* adapter we push the frame pointer and  corresponding frame metadata to the 
* NotificationQueue. The frame data is not copied, however the metadata is
* copied.
* The PVCAM callback thread is immediately released, allowing PVCAM to wait for
* the next frame, reducing the risk of losing a callback due to blocking the
* PVCAM callback thread too long.
* The NotificationThread is notified about new frame available, pops the
* pointer from the queue and starts pushing it to MMCore.
* During that period the PVCAM callback for next frame may arrive and next
* frame pointer is pushed to the NotificationThread.
*
* Ideally the actual size of the NotificationQueue is 1 frame. However during
* temporary CPU load hiccups the NotificationQueue may grow a little.
*
* If the camera produces frames faster than MM can consume them, there is no
* cure for this. In such situations we always drop the oldest frame from the
* queue. The MaxSize of the NotificationQueue should always be a couple of
* frames less than the circular buffer size - this is to avoid a situation
* where PVCAM starts overwriting a frame in the circular buffer that is
* currently being copied by the MMCore to its own "Sequence Buffer".
*
* For example, if we have CircularBuffer size of 16 frames and max Queue size
* of 10 frames there is a 4 frames gap. This 4 frames gap should give us 
* enough time to copy the oldest frame to MMCore (without a risk of being
* overwritten by PVCAM) if the NotificationQueue is getting full.
*
* This entire class would not have to be used if PVCAM had its own callback
* queue and deliver the callbacks more reliably.
