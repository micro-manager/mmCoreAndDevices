Install the Thorlabs TSP01 SDK
(https://www.thorlabs.com/software_pages/viewsoftwarepage.cfm?code=TSP).

Create a directory called "3rdparty" at the same level as the "micro-manager"
source code directory. In there, create 'Thorlabs/TSP01-2.1/VISA/Win64' as a
copy of C:/Program Files/IVI Foundation/VISA/Win64.

(If using a version other than 2.1 or a different location, adjust the project
settings (AdditionalIncludeDirectories and AdditionalLibraryDirectories) as
appropriate.)
