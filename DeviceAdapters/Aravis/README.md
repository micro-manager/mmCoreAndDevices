## About

These device adapters add support for the [Aravis Project](https://github.com/AravisProject). The adapters have been developed and tested on 64-bit Linux with Aravis-0.10.

### Note

For the cameras used to test this driver there were two choices for the same camera at hardware configuration, and only one of the two choices worked as expected.
