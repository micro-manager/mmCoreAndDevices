""" Sample microscope
=======================
This script simulates a microscopic imaging system, generating a random noise image as a mock source and capturing it
through a microscope with adjustable magnification, numerical aperture, and wavelength. It visualizes the original and
processed images dynamically, demonstrating how changes in optical parameters affect image quality and resolution.
