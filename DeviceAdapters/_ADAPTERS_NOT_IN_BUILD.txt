CanonEDSDK: Attempt to get the Canon SDK to work, gave up since the callback that was supposed to be generated by the camera never called back...
NIDAQ: Interface to one of the NI APIs.  This actually worked (on the Mac), but Nico got so disappointed while working on it that he switched to using the Arduino.
PiMotionStage: Superseded by PI_GCS_2, and dependencies not available
Skeleton: Provided as a code example
StanfordPhotonics: Superseded by Piper

Updated for migration to Meson:
	AndorSDK3 was too messy to include in the new build. It had many source files that were not meant to be included and it included many source files that were from other adapters.
	Basler also too complicated.
	ITC18 windows: SDK binaries were too old to use. Source could not be compiled on windows.
	BioStepEagleIce: Only supported 32 bit build which we are now dropping. Couldn't find any info about this device online.
	Jenoptik: Compiler Errors.
	MCL_Nano and Micro Drive: Compiler errors, probably need to recompile SDK: 
		MadLib64.lib(CNanoDrive.obj) : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol printf
		MadLib64.lib(core.obj) : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol __iob_func
		MadLib64.lib(core.obj) : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _snprintf
		MadLib64.lib(core.obj) : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _vsnprintf
		MadLib64.lib(windows_winusb.obj) : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol sscanf
	Mightex: Relies on old version of windows DDK. doesn't work for new compilers.
	NIDAQ: Binary of SDK is missing. No longer supported.
	NIMotionStageController: SDK only supported 32bit
	SPOT (windows): Only supported 32 bit. If re-added should be included in the original Spot project, not copy a separate project.
	ZeissAxioZoom: DATABYTES undeclared identifier
